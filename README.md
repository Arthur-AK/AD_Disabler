# AD_Disabler

AD Disabler is designed to have multiple computers that are named based on an asset number or serial number disabled.

When the script is run using run.bat it will automatically ask for Admin rights and only run the ps1 file if you are admin.

## You will then be asked for the default computer name
If all of your computers start with the same few numbers or letters this is where you would enter them. This section accepts wildcards!

## You are then presented with the form where you enter the computers
Computers are then entered line by line and the "Disable Computers" button is pushed. Saving the time of searching each computer individually.

After the button is pushed you are asked for each computer if you want to disable it or not.
